<!-- * My research interests include medical image analysis and deep learning. Recently, I am dedicated to multi-modal learning with vision, text, audio, and gaze, out-of-distribution generalization, zero/few-shot learning, learning with noisy labels. Previously, I studied topics of making adequate use of unlabeled data and augmenting the limited labeled data for data-efficient deep learning.  -->
<!-- * My research interest is in the interdisciplinary field of medical image analysis, computer vision, and machine learning, aiming to create innovative intelligent systems that can support the high-quality medical diagnosis and interventions.  -->
