* I am currently a Ph.D student in the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML) at **The University of Adelaide**, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/gustavo-carneiro" target="_blank">Gustavo Carneiro</a>, working on the <a href="https://www.acmd.org.au/braix" target="_blank">Transforming Breast Cancer Screening with Artificial Intelligence (BRAIx) Project</a>.
* I obtained M. Eng. degree in College of Electrical and Information Engineering at **Hunan University** in 2020, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.leyuanfang.com/about-me/" target="_blank">Leyuan Fang</a>.
* I received B. Eng. degree in School of Biomedical Engineering at **Southern Medical University** in 2017.
* I visited United Imaging Intelligence (UII) and ShanghaiTech University during 2020-2021, advised by Prof. <a href="https://bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn/bme_en/2021/0205/c8252a85165/page.htm" target="_blank">Dinggang Shen</a>. 

I am on the academic job market for faculty positions in AI for healthcare, targeting assistant professorship positions in EE/BME/CS. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any relevant job opportunities.

<!-- * My research interests include medical image analysis and deep learning. Recently, I am dedicated to multi-modal learning with vision, text, audio, and gaze, out-of-distribution generalization, zero/few-shot learning, learning with noisy labels. Previously, I studied topics of making adequate use of unlabeled data and augmenting the limited labeled data for data-efficient deep learning.  -->
