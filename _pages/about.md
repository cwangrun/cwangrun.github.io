* I am currently a Ph.D student in the Australian Institute for Machine Learning (AIML), **University of Adelaide**, supervised by Prof. <a href="https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/gustavo-carneiro" target="_blank">Gustavo Carneiro</a>, working on the <a href="https://www.acmd.org.au/braix" target="_blank">Transforming Breast Cancer Screening with Artificial Intelligence (BRAIx) Project</a>.
* I obtained M. Eng. degree in College of Electrical and Information Engineering at **Hunan University** in 2020, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.leyuanfang.com/about-me/" target="_blank">Leyuan Fang</a>.
* I received B. Eng. degree in School of Biomedical Engineering at **Southern Medical University** in 2017.
* I visited United Imaging Intelligence (UII) and ShanghaiTech University during 2020-2021, advised by Prof. <a href="https://bme.shanghaitech.edu.cn/bme_en/2021/0205/c8252a85165/page.htm" target="_blank">Dinggang Shen</a>. 

I am on the academic job market for faculty positions in AI for healthcare, targeting assistant professorship positions in EE/BME/CS. Please don't hesitate to reach out to me if you have any relevant job opportunities.

I am passionate about delving into the interdisciplinary field of medical image analysis, computer vision, and machine learning, dedicating to advancing artificial intelligence (AI) solutions in healthcare, with a particular focus on creating trustworthy techniques for medical diagnosis and interventions.

Dr. Cui's work has been published in prestigious journals and conferences including Nature Communications, TMI, MedIA, TNNLS, MICCAI, CVPR, and ECCV, etc.

 
* Previously, I focused on developing <a href="https://guo-xiaoqing.github.io/research/" target="_blank">annotation-efficient deep learning</a> solutions, such as data augmentation, semi-supervised learning, domain adaptation, out-of-distribution generalization, and learning with noisy labels, to achieve trustworthy and effective intelligent systems.
